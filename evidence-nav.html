        <h2 class="text-center">Explore Interoperability within the Health Space</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"> The approach of the Standard Health Record (SHR) is to standardize the health record and health data itself, rather than focusing on exchange standards. When the health record and data is standardized, exchange and aggregation of patient information will become trivial (as in every other industry that has gone standard and digital). Below are articles, papers and thinkpieces from the health community that demonstrate the different ways SHR-enabled interoperability will impact the health space.</p>
