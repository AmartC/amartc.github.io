        <p style="text-align: left;"> The approach of the Standard Health Record (SHR) is to standardize the health record and health data itself, rather than focusing on exchange standards. When the health record and data is standardized, exchange and aggregation of patient information will become trivial (as in every other industry that has gone digital). </p>

              <p>The SHR Collaborative is an open-source health data interoperability effort based at The MITRE Corporation located in Bedford, MA. The SHR Collaborative aims to address the challenge of health data interoperability by focusing on the establishment of standards for the structure and content of health record information.</p>
              <p>The SHR Collaborative is recommending and prototyping health records that leverage existing medical record models and account for the data needs of patient identification and primary and emergency care providers. The SHR is also actively addressing the dynamic needs of patients and their caregivers over the life course by including a specification for many areas related to social determinants of health.</p>
              <p>The SHR Collaborative is patient-centric, while being highly attuned to the needs of care providers across a wide-spectrum of disciplines, and holds that patients must have access to their data in an understandable, portable, and transparent manner. As an open source model, the SHR actively promotes industry innovation in leveraging big-data at the patient and population level to increase patient engagement, support public health and research needs, and ensure providers have the right information, at the right time, for the right person.</p>

            <p class="faq-title title">What is the Standard Health Record?</p>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The Standard Health Record establishes a US national standard for the content of electronic health records. Health records conforming to the SHR specification contain all information critical to patient identification, emergency and primary care. Future extensions will support emerging treatment paradigms such as genomics, microbiomics, and precision medicine. Patients own the information in their SHRs and control who can access them and contribute information.</p>
              <p>Widespread SHR implementation will result in interoperability across geographical locations and care settings. Health-related services including telecare, clinical decision support, and quality measurement are supported by SHR, improving healthcare access, quality, and uniformity. SHR provides the foundation for collection, communication, and aggregation of patient data, accelerating secondary uses in public health, disease surveillance, post-approval monitoring, and patient-centered outcomes ersearch. Patients, clinicians, and the American public will realize major benefits from improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, and decreased costs that accompany healthier lives. </p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes. The development of the SHR and all resources are open source since the very start of the effort. You can find the SHR on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth">https://github.com/standardhealth</a>. If you are interested in participating in the development of the SHR please email <a href="mailto:shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org">shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org</a> or enter an issue on the SHR GitHub page. </p>
