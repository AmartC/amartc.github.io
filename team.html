        <h1 class="title">Standard Health Record Blue Ribbon Panel</h1>
        <p>The Standard Health Record (SHR) initiative will derive critical value from the guidance and support of a Blue Ribbon Panel. The Panel will serve for multiple years during the early stages of the initiative and contain experts representing clinical, patient advocacy, health information technology, health law and policy, and public health domains. </p>
        <h2>The Panel&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
        <p>Panel members will provide guidance and support to the SHR development team in all aspects of carrying out the mission, vision, and goals of the SHR initiative. The Panel will be supported by, and have regular communication with, the SHR development team. The Panel may form workgroups from within and outside the Panel membership to carry out its charge.</p>
        
        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The Panel will be convened in November 2016 and will meet in full three times a year. At the conclusion of each year of service the Panel will provide recommendations to the SHR development team to guide the following yearâ€™s objectives. </p>
