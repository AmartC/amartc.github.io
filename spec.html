          <h2>Patient Identification</h2>
          <p>SHR will contain patient attributes that make it searchable by an Electronic Master Patient Index (eMPI). Patient identification attributes include: date of birth, last name, first name, address, mother&rsquo;s maiden name, place of birth, etc.</p>

          <h2>Emergency Care</h2>
          <p>Medical errors can occur in the ED when providers lack critical patient information (e.g. medications, allergies). The SHR will contain critical patient information, including advance directives, that could impact emergency care.</p>

          <h2>Primary Care</h2>
          <p>A comprehensive view of the patient&rsquo;s data needed to support a primary care encounter is a priority in the SHR. Patient data is aggregated from multiple sources (e.g. clinician visits, urgent care centers and patients themselves) and presented meaningfully to clinicians and patients.</p>
