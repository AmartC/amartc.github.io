          <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
          <h3>Modernizing Healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            The SHR provides the foundation for the collection, communication, and aggregation of patient data, accelerating secondary uses in public health, disease surveillance, post-approval monitoring, and patient-centered outcomes research. By architecting a single set of standards for health-related data, the SHR can realize clinical interoperability and support a wide-range of clinicians, caregivers and healthcare providers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Enabling transparency and precise communication across the healthcare system, the SHR will lead clinicians and the American public to realize major benefits through improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, and decreased costs that accompany healthier lives.

          <h2>THE SPEC BEHIND SHR</h2>
          <h3>Prioritizing High Quality Data</h3>
          <p>
            The SHR specification will contain all information critical to patient identification, emergency and primary care. The collaborative is currently prototyping health record specifications that leverage existing medical record models and account for the data needs of patient identification and primary and emergency care providers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The SHR also actively addresses the dynamic needs of patients over the course of their life by capturing many areas related to social determinants of health. Future extensions will support emerging treatment paradigms such as genomics, microbiomics, and precision medicine. Patients own the information in their SHRs and control who can access them and contribute information.

          <h3>Collaborating on a Global Scale</h3>
          <p> 
            The development of the SHR and all resources are open source and have been since its inception. If you are interested in participating in the development of the SHR <a href="mailto:shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org" style="font-weight: 600; white-space:nowrap">please email us here</a> or enter an issue on the  <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth" style="font-weight: 600; white-space:nowrap"> SHR GitHub page</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have questions for the collaborative about what makes the SHR unique, what separates the SHR from a personal health record and traditional EHR's, see our list of <a href="/faq.html" style="font-weight: 600; white-space:nowrap">frequently asked questions</a> or <a href="mailto:shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org" style="font-weight: 600; white-space:nowrap">send us an email</a>.
