          <h2>Collaboratively building a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States</h2>
          <p>Our vision is to fundamentally shift how health data is digitally recorded and shared to ensure that comprehensive, high quality data is available on demand.</p>
          <p>Achieving this vision, and aligning disparate health data, requires an agreed on format for healthcare data elements, value sets,
          and measurement units. Through this shared technological foundation, we can solve clinical interoperability and better support a wide-range of clinicians,
          empower patients and caregivers, and provide transparency within the healthcare system.</p>
