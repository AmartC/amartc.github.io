<!--           <h2>Standard Health Record </h2> -->
          <p><a href="http://standardhealthrecord.org">The Standard Health Record Collaborative</a> is working to create a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States.</p>
          <p>Our vision is to fundamentally shift how health data is digitally recorded and shared to improve patient outcomes. When adopted, the SHR data model solves semantic interoperability for healthcare. As an open source project, the SHR engages a broad community and can provide a powerful model for global health.</p>
          <p><strong>To contribute</strong> please visit the SHRC's <a href="https://github.com/standardhealth">Github page</a> to view our projects, explore the current version of the <a href="http://standardhealthrecord.org/shr/">SHR specification</a>, and start a dialog with the Collaborative <a href="mailto:shr-project-list@lists.mitre.org">via email</a>.</p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea">Synthea</a> is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions. It can be used without restriction for a variety of secondary uses in academia, research, industry, and government.

<!--           <h1 id="background">Background</h1> -->
          <p><a href="http://syntheticmass.mitre.org">SyntheticMass</a> is model of all 7 million (soon!) residents of the state of Massachusetts, with artificial health records for the fictional residents. This establishes a risk-free environment for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data Visualization</li>
            <li>Risk stratification</li>
            <li>Care management</li>
            <li>Clinical decision support</li>
            <li>Patient Reported data integration</li>
            <li>Evaluation of new treatment models</li>
            <li>Privacy and consent models</li>
            <li>Security and authorization models</li>
            <li>Third-party app development</li>
          </ul>

          <p>SyntheticMass will provide a sandbox for Health IT developers, researchers and clinicians interested in prototyping new healthcare solutions. It enables this through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Realistic data for fictional patients</li>
            <li>Data that is free of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) constraints</li>
            <li>Datasets updated over time based on clinical healthcare models and epidemiological models of population health.</li>

            <a href="http://www.mitre.org">The MITRE Corporation</a> is a not-for-profit company working in the public interest, operating multiple federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). FFRDCs are unique organizations that assist the United States government with scientific research and analysis, development and acquisition, and systems engineering and integration. MITRE does not have commercial interests and cannot compete for anything except the right to operate FFRDCs. This lack of commercial conflicts of interest forms the basis for MITREâ€™s objectivity and subsequent ability to acquire sensitive and proprietary information from the government and industry to inform critical initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH) FFRDC, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), assists both the CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in performing research and analysis on various topics that fall within the national health domain. As the CAMH FFRDC operator and partner, MITRE serves as an objective, independent advisor to CMS and HHS operating divisions. As the only broadly healthcare-focused FFRDC, CAMH supports many of the complex analysis and critical thinking requirements that encompass the business, policy, technology, and operational interests across CMS and HHS.
