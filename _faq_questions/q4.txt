title: "Is the SHR technical approach different than what has been done in the past for Health Data Interoperability in the US?"
paragraphs: 
    - 
      p: "Yes. To explain why the SHR approach is different requires some background."
    - 
      p: "Twenty years ago, the healthcare industry turned towards interoperability standards to improve healthcare information exchange. However, the very lack of data consistency s not acknowledged and has led to exchange standards that are purposefully left extremely flexible, allowing enough freedom to model the information in virtually any EHR system.ven new standards like HL7’s FAST Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) have made a deliberate decision to remain very flexible and ambiguous on data specificity. While IR provides a far more solid foundation then previous healthcare exchange standards, problems of inconsistent implementation and low levels of semantic interoperability remain."
    - 
      p: "Today there are over 1,500 different EMR/EHR health IT system products certified as part of HHS Meaningful Use. Most of those health IT products are themselves highly nfigurable to facilitate conditions in divergent clinical settings. This explains why, even after the nearly universal adoption of health IT technology has occurred, the imary mechanism of communication between clinicians remains the fax machine which is reliant on manual human interpretation of text on paper."
    - 
      p: "In our view, the real problem lies much deeper than the flexibility of information exchange standards. In addition to capturing too much information as free text, the ndamental problem is that today’s health IT systems contain semantically incompatible information. Because of the great variety of the data models of EMR/EHR systems, ansferring information from one health IT system to another frequently results in distorted or lost information, blocking of critical details, or introduction of erroneous formation. This is unacceptable in healthcare. Under these circumstances, the solution must lie in aligning the information at the sources."
    - 
      p: "The approach of the Standard Health Record (SHR) is to standardize the health record and health data itself, rather than focusing on exchange standards. When the health record and data is standardized, exchange and aggregation of patient information will become trivial (as in every other industry that has gone digital)."
