    <h1 class="title">The Standard Health Record Initiative</h1>
    <p>Our vision is to fundamentally shift how care providers and individuals obtain and use health information across multiple care settings to manage acute and preventive health. This shift begins by defining the content of a Standard Health Record (SHR) to be used by patients and care providers across the US. Populated by real-time, meaningful data, the SHR empowers individuals and care teams to collaborate and focus on shared-decision making.</p>
    <p>The level of fragmentation present in the US healthcare system today has reached a point where it is jeopardizing patient safety and creating burden for patients and their caregivers. A well-executed SHR will move the health system past this reactive, fragmented model toward a longitudinal, prevention-focused, and personalized system that will increase quality and reduce cost while addressing patient needs.</p>
    <p>Rather than focusing on defining health data exchange standards, the Standard Health Record provides a model for standard content, values, and measurement units. This model provides a common operational picture of the patient, which eliminates many of the core challenges that have limited the realization of successful health data exchange.</p>

      <h2 class="title">The Standard Health Record establishes a US national standard for the content of electronic health records.</h2>
      <p>Health records conforming to the SHR specification contain all information critical to patient identification, emergency and primary care. Future extensions will support emerging treatment paradigms such as genomics, microbiomics, and precision medicine. Widespread SHR implementation will result in interoperability across geographical locations and care settings. Health-related services including telecare, clinical decision support, and quality measurement are supported by SHR, improving healthcare access, quality, and uniformity. SHR provides the foundation for collection, communication, and aggregation of patient data, accelerating secondary uses in public health, disease surveillance, post-approval monitoring, and patient-centered outcomes research. Patients, clinicians, and the American public will realize major benefits from improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, and decreased costs that accompany healthier lives.</p>

    <p>We are in the early stages of prototyping and defining the SHR, and seek multidisciplinary collaboration with individuals and organizations that are forward thinking in terms of meaningful health data interoperability and true precision health for individuals and populations. In addition to ongoing outreach efforts, select collaborators will be invited to join our Blue Ribbon Panel; making a multi-year commitment to evolve the SHRâ€™s development by advising on its concept, content, and direction.</p>
    <p>Our growing list of supporters represents a diverse collective of leaders from areas such as nationally recognized provider organizations, health IT vendors, insurance providers, clinical researchers, and government policy makers. Our collaborators are essential to the successful establishment and adoption of the Standard Health Record on a national as well as international scale.</p>

    <h2 class="title">About MITRE</h2>
    <p>MITRE is a not-for-profit organization that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government. MITRE operate FFRDCs, federally funded research and development centers, which are unique organizations that assist the United States government with Scientific research and analysis, Development and acquisition, and Systems engineering and integration. MITRE also has an independent research program that explores new and expanded uses of technologies to solve national problems in the public interest.</p>
    <p>The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH) FFRDC, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), assists both the CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in performing research and analysis on various topics that fall within the national health domain.  As the CAMH FFRDC operator and partner, MITRE serves as an objective, independent advisor to CMS and HHS operating divisions. As the only broadly healthcare-focused FFRDC, CAMH supports many of the complex analysis and critical thinking requirements that encompass the business, policy, technology, and operational interests across CMS and HHS.</p>
