##Making Contributions:
To make contributions to the standardhealthrecord.org, two main strategies are currently being employed:

1. Lodge any issues or comments you have on the [issue page here](https://github.com/standardhealth/standardhealth.github.io/issues). This will help the collaborative know about content you see missing from the site, weird styling bugs you notice, and ways the Standard Health Record can be improved.
2. [Fork the project](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on GitHub, make changes to your copy of the files, and [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to the main repository. Note: *Never push changes directly to the repository without issuing a pull request*. This step is key in allowing individuals to review changes prior to merging with any live versions of the website.
