    <h1 class="title">The Standard Health Record Initiative</h1>
    <p>The Standard Health Record (SHR) establishes the one human, one health record approach to healthcare by developing a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States. When adopted, the SHR data model solves semantic interoperability for healthcare. As an open source project, the SHR engages a broad community and can provide a powerful model for global health.</p>
    <p>Our vision is to fundamentally shift how health data is digitally recorded and shared to improve patient outcomes. To date, most patients and providers lack the aggregated, timely, understandable, and personalized health data needed for individual decision-making and healthcare management. To achieve a high level of health data quality and enable tools to leverage large volumes of digital information, data quality must be addressed at a foundational level. The standards are the foundation by which data are recorded at the data element, value set, and measurement unit level in the digital health record. Health records conforming to the SHR specification will, at first, contain all information critical to patient identification, emergency/trauma care, and primary care. Future extensions will support additional healthcare domains over time.</p>

        <h1 class="title" id="brp">Standard Health Record<br>Blue Ribbon Panel</h1>
        <p>The Standard Health Record (SHR) initiative will derive critical value from the guidance and support of a Blue Ribbon Panel. The Panel will serve for multiple years during the early stages of the initiative and contain experts representing clinical, patient advocacy, health information technology, health law and policy, and public health domains. </p>
        <h2>The Panel&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
        <p>Panel members will provide guidance and support to the SHR development team in all aspects of carrying out the mission, vision, and goals of the SHR initiative. The Panel will be supported by, and have regular communication with, the SHR development team. The Panel may form workgroups from within and outside the Panel membership to carry out its charge.</p>

<!--         <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The Panel will be convened in November 2016 and will meet in full three times a year. At the conclusion of each year of service the Panel will provide recommendations to the SHR development team to guide the following year’s objectives. </p>

    <h2 class="title" id="mitre">About MITRE</h2>
    <p>The MITRE Corporation is a not-for-profit company that operates multiple federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). FFRDCs are unique organizations that assist the United States government with scientific research and analysis, development and acquisition, and systems engineering and integration. Additionally, MITRE maintains an independent research program that explores new and expanded uses of technologies to solve national problems in the public interest. MITRE does not have commercial interests and cannot compete for anything except the right to operate FFRDCs. This lack of commercial conflicts of interest forms the basis for MITRE’s objectivity and subsequent ability to acquire sensitive and proprietary information from the government and industry to inform critical initiatives.</p>
    <p>The CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH) FFRDC, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), assists both the CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in performing research and analysis on various topics that fall within the national health domain.  As the CAMH FFRDC operator and partner, MITRE serves as an objective, independent advisor to CMS and HHS operating divisions. As the only broadly healthcare-focused FFRDC, CAMH supports many of the complex analysis and critical thinking requirements that encompass the business, policy, technology, and operational interests across CMS and HHS.</p>
