    <h1 class="title">The Standard Health Record Initiative</h1>
    <p>Our vision is to fundamentally shift how health information is created and shared within the US health system by defining a national Standard Health Record (SHR). The SHR provides a model for health data based on standard content, values, and measurement units. This standardization is foundational to creating a common operational picture of the patient that contains the <em>right</em> data.</p>
    <p>Through the SHR, many of the challenges to successful health data exchange can be eliminated. With the right data at the right time, the SHR will support individual and population level care including improved care coordination, reduction of medical errors, and decreased costs.</p>
    <h2>The Standard Health Record is:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patient-centric, logitudinal, and personalized</li>
      <li>A simple, computable record that defines core human attributes for care</li>
      <li>Understandable and verifiable by patients, clinicians, and algorithms</li>
      <li>Open source software</li>
      <li>Critical to solving healthcare semantic interoperability</li>
    </ul>
<p>The Standard Health Record is a MITRE Corporation initiative. MITRE is committed to adhering to its long-standing fiduciary role as a neutral and trusted advisor working in the public interest as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) operator and partner supporting the CMS Alliance to Modernize Healthcare (CAMH).</p>

        <h1 class="title" id="brp">Standard Health Record<br>Blue Ribbon Panel</h1>
        <p>The Standard Health Record (SHR) initiative will derive critical value from the guidance and support of a Blue Ribbon Panel. The Panel will serve for multiple years during the early stages of the initiative and contain experts representing clinical, patient advocacy, health information technology, health law and policy, and public health domains. </p>
        <h2>The Panel&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
        <p>Panel members will provide guidance and support to the SHR development team in all aspects of carrying out the mission, vision, and goals of the SHR initiative. The Panel will be supported by, and have regular communication with, the SHR development team. The Panel may form workgroups from within and outside the Panel membership to carry out its charge.</p>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <p>The Panel will be convened in November 2016 and will meet in full three times a year. At the conclusion of each year of service the Panel will provide recommendations to the SHR development team to guide the following yearâ€™s objectives. </p>
