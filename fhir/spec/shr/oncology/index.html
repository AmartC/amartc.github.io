<h3><a name="HER2Status"></a>HER2Status [Entry]</h3>
<p>HER2 is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family of proteins and is encoded by the ERBB2 oncogene. HER2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast tumors,10 and is associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. HER2 status (positive=present or overexpressed; negative=absent) is a factor in determining prognosis and treatment options.</p>
