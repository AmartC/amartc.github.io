<h3><a name="HumanEpiduralGrowthFactorReceptor2Status"></a>HumanEpiduralGrowthFactorReceptor2Status [Entry]</h3>
<p>HER2 is a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family of proteins and is encoded by the ERBB2 oncogene. HER2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast tumors,10 and is associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. HER2 status (positive=present or overexpressed; negative=absent) is a factor in determining prognosis and treatment options. <a href="http://ncimeta.nci.nih.gov/C3810543">C3810543</a></p>

<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationCode"><code>ObservationCode</code></a></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked.</td>

The clinically relevant time is not necessarily when the information is gathered or when a test is carried out, but for example, when a specimen was collected, or the time period referred to by the question. Use a TimePeriod for a measurement or specimen collection continued over a significant period of time (e.g. 24 hour Urine Sodium).</td>

<td>A protein located on the cell surface, or in the cytoplasm, that binds to a specific signaling factor, such as a hormone, antigen, or neurotransmitter, causing a conformational and functional change in the receptor molecule. The ligand-bound receptor then alters its interaction with target molecules, which leads to changes in cellular physiology through modification of the activity of one or more signal transduction pathways.</td>
