<td>Based On: <a href="../observation/index.html#Observation"><code>Observation</code></a></td>
<td></td>
<td>A statement about an act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. The method of observing can be via questions, assessment, laboratory test, or imaging procedure.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationCode"><code>ObservationCode</code></a></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked.</td>

<td>Coding of a concept, drawn from a controlled vocabulary. Includes the vocabulary and version, if applicable. May include a display text, and a descriptor expressing the intended interpretation of the code</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationNotMade"><code>ObservationNotMade</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>Whether the observation described by the specific concept code was not made (or not ordered). This is the equivalent of 'not asked'. Particularly important if an observation or test is normally ordered, but was not ordered in a particular instance. This is distinct from a missing value, in which the observation was attempted (the question asked), but the value normally resulting from the observation was not obtained (question not answered).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationNotMadeReason"><code>ObservationNotMadeReason</code></a></td>
<td>optional</td>
<td>An explanation of why the observation was not made (or ordered), i.e., why the question was not asked.</td>

<td>The number of people living together with mutual financial dependency. Besides the subject, the household size may include spouse or partner, dependent children including adopted and foster children, dependent parents, dependent siblings and other relatives, but not roommates, ex-spouses, non-dependent children, and unborn children. If the subject lives alone, the household size is 1.</td>
