<td>Based On: <a href="../observation/index.html#Observation"><code>Observation</code></a></td>
<td></td>
<td>A statement about an act that is intended to result in new information about a subject. The focus of an observation can include the subject's behavior, physiological state, functional status, environment, exposures to substances, etc. The method of observing can be via questions, assessment, laboratory test, or imaging procedure.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="../observation/index.html#ObservationCode"><code>ObservationCode</code></a></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A term from a controlled vocabulary that defines the data element (the question, not the answer) as specifically as possible. The specific code should always align with the concept of the element, but may be more specific. For example, the concept associated with medications is code for 'medication used', but the ObservationCode is the code for the particular medication used. For tests, ObservationCode identifies the specific test being performed, and for observations, the specific question being asked.</td>

This is distinct from a missing value, in which the observation was attempted (the question asked), but the value normally resulting from the observation was not obtained (question not answered).</td>
