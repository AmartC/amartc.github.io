<h3><a name="ObservationNotMade"></a>ObservationNotMade</h3>
<p>Whether the observation described by the specific concept code was not made (or not ordered). This is the equivalent of 'not asked'. Particularly important if an observation or test is normally ordered, but was not ordered in a particular instance. This is distinct from a missing value, in which the observation was attempted (the question asked), but the value normally resulting from the observation was not obtained (question not answered).</p>
